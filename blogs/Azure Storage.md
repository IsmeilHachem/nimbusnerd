# üöÄ Storage: The Cosmic Warehouse

In the vast expanse of the Azure cosmos, the Storage Account is our interstellar warehouse. It's a massive, scalable storage system for objects and files, capable of storing messages and NoSQL data. You might wonder why choose this when there are other storage options in the universe. The benefits of Azure's Storage account are:

- Durability and high availability
- Fine-grained access control for security
- Easy scalability
- Managed by MS, so you don't have to do the heavy lifting

Azure Storage can be used to store data for three categories:

1. Virtual Machine (VM) storage
2. Unstructured data
3. Structured data

Let's embark on a cosmic journey through these categories.

## üåå Virtual Machine (VM) Storage

When thinking VM storage, think of disks and files for that VM. Disks represent persistent block store while files are fully managed file shares.

## üå† Unstructured Data

For unstructured data, we store things like blobs and data lake. Blobs, which we'll talk more about later, are highly scalable, REST-based object storage. Data lake represents a Hadoop distributed file system, a big talk for "handles big data".

## üåê Structured Data

Last but not least, structured data. Think tables, CosmosDB, and AzSQL. We'll talk about tables later in this blog but CosmosDB and AzSQL will be a blog of their own.

There are two types of Storage accounts; Standard and Premium. Standard provides you with the lowest cost/GB, ideal for bulk storage or dealing with infrequently accessed data. Premium, while a tad bit more expensive, provides consistent low-latency performance, ideal for input/output intensive applications. Be careful, once you've picked a type, the selection cannot be undone!

Now that we've talked about the types, let's explore the five services:

1. Blob
2. Data Lake Gen 2
3. Azure Files
4. Queue
5. Table

We promised a deeper dive into blobs, so let's plunge into the cosmic ocean!

## üåë Blob Storage

Blob storage, also known as "object store", stores large amounts of unstructured data. Blobs are ideal for:

- Serving images/documents directly to the browser
- Storing files for distributed access
- Streaming video and audio data
- Storing backup, disaster recovery, and archival data
- Storing analysis data

When it comes to naming a blob, it wants to be unique. You can only use lowercases, numbers, and hyphens. The name must begin with a letter or number and it must be between 3-63 characters long. Blobs also have versioning which allows for object replication.

There are three types of blobs; block, append, and page. Block blobs are the default option, ideal for text and binary data. Append is ideal for appending operations aka logging scenarios. Page is ideal for frequent read/write operations. VMs use page blobs for OS and data disks.

## üåå Azure Files

Azure Files sets up highly available network file shares that are accessed via Server Message Block (SMB). This is ideal for:

- Migrating on-prem files to azure
- Storing config files
- Storing logs, metrics, and crash dumps

When wanting to connect to azure file share, ensure port 445 is open because SMB communicates over this port.

## üå† Queue and Tables

Queue's purpose is simply to store and retrieve messages. Table is ideal when working with structured, non-relational data.

## üåê Replication Options: The Cosmic Clones

In the Azure cosmos, data replication is akin to creating cosmic clones of your data. These clones ensure your data's durability and availability, even in the face of interstellar calamities. Azure offers four types of replication options:

1. **Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)**: This is the most cost-effective option, but also the least durable. It's like having three clones of your data in a single datacenter. Ideal for easily reconstructed data and constantly changing data such as live feeds.

2. **Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)**: This is LRS taken to the next level. Your data is replicated across three availability zones within a single region, like having your data clones spread across different planets in the same solar system.

3. **Geo Redundant Storage (GRS)**: This is like LRS but it replicates to a secondary region asynchronously. The secondary region is only accessed once a failover is initiated. It's like having a backup planet in another solar system.

4. **Geo-Zone Redundant Storage (GZRS)**: This is the ultimate combination of ZRS and GRS. It's like having your data clones spread across different planets in multiple solar systems. This is ideal if you want consistent, durable, highly available, excellent performance, and resiliency for disaster recovery.

Both Geo options have their own read access version; RA-GRS and RA-GZRS. These are like having a telescope that can read your data from the backup planet without having to travel there.

## üöÄ Security in the Storage Realm

All data is auto encrypted via Server Side Encryption (SSE). Few ways to handle authorization requests are:

- Azure AD
- Shared Keys
- SAS tokens

SAS tokens or shared access signature is a secure way to share resources without compromising account keys.

## üåå Configuring Storage Tools and AzCopy

Couple tools we'll talk about are Azure Storage Explorer and Import/Export service. The storage explorer is a standalone app that manages all the storage content. Import/Export Service is used when wanting to securely import/export large data to/from blobs and files by shipping drives to/from the azure datacenter or on-premise site.

AzCopy is a command used to copy data to/from blobs and file storage. This is an ideal tool for incremental copy scenarios.

That's a whole lot of information! Let's take a snack break before departing to the next adventure. Our next stop on this journey will be Compute and it shouldn't be taken lightly. This part will make up the core infrastructure of our cloud. Until then, keep exploring, and may the cloud be with you, young astronaut! üöÄ
