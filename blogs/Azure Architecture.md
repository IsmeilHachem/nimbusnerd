## The Cosmic Compass

1. [Identity and Governance](./Azure%20Identity%20and%20Governance)
2. [Storage](./Azure%20Storage)
3. [Compute](./Azure%20Compute)
4. [Networking](./Azure%20Networking)
5. [Monitoring](./Azure%20Monitoring)

We will be following the path of this trail and making pit stops at each number, showing you how it all pieces together to form the marvelous Microsoft Azure universe.

Now, let's ignite our engines and set course for our first celestial destination: Identity and Governance! Until our next interstellar interaction, keep your curiosity aflame, continue your cosmic journey, and remember - in the boundless universe of cloud computing, the cloud is your faithful galactic guide. Until our next adventure, young grasshopper! üöÄ‚ú®
